# UnicamChess
An application for playing chess.

## Objective
Use [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) to implement the Clock the Pieces specifications.

Proceed as follows:
 * Read the first entry in the [specific](Documents/ClockSpecification.md);
 * Write a test in the [ClockTests class](Tests/ClockTests.cs). Don't forget to use Assert instructions. Run the application and watch the test fail (a.k.a "red phase");
 * Now, open the [Clock class](Model/Clock.cs) and type the minimum quantity of code that makes the test pass;
 * Run the application again and verify that the test is now passing (a.k.a. "green phase");
 * Repeat until all of the entries in the specific have been implemented and tested. Please keep in mind that each entry might require one or more tests.
